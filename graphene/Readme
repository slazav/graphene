Graphene -- a simple time-series database for scientific applications

Source code: https://github.com/slazav/graphene
E-mail: Vladislav Zavjalov <slazav@altlinux.org>

Features:
- based on BerkleyDB
- store integer, floating point or text values with millisecond timestamps
- fast access to data, interpolation, time ranges, downsampling
- multi-column numerical values
- command line and xinetd network interface for reading/writing data
- http simple json interface for Grafana viewer
- user filters for data processing (calibration tables etc.)

=========================================================================
    Data storage

Each dataset is a separate BerkleyDB file with .db extension, located in
a database directory (default /var/lib/graphene). Name of file represents
the name of the dataset. Name may contain path symbols '/', but can not
contain symbols '.:|+ \t\n', You can use name "cryostat/temperature" but
not "../temperature" for your dataset. Currently all subfolders have to
be created manually.

Data are stored as a set of sorted key-value pairs. Key is time in
milliseconds (64-bit unsigned integer), counted from 1970-01-01 UTC.
Duplicated time values are allowed (but can not be correctly shown now).
Value can contain an array if numbers of arbitrary length (data columns)
or some text. The data format can be chosen during the database
creation. Possible variants are: TEXT, INT8, UINT8, INT16, UINT16,
INT32, UINT32, INT64, UINT64, FLOAT, DOUBLE.

Records with 8-bit keys are reserved for database information, for
example the data format and database description. Records with 16-bit
keys are reserved for arbitrary user data. These records are not
affected by regular get/put commands.

=========================================================================
    Command line interface to data

The program graphene is used to access data from command line.
Usage: graphene [options] <command> <parameters>

    Options:

-d <path> -- database directory (default /var/lib/graphene/)
-h        -- write this help message and exit

    Commands for manipulating databases:

$ graphene create <name> [<data_fmt>] [<description>]  -- create a database file
$ graphene delete <name>                  -- delete a database file
$ graphene rename <old_name> <new_name>   -- rename a database file
$ graphene set_descr <name> <description> -- change database description
$ graphene info <name>                    -- print database format and description
$ graphene list                           -- list all databases in the data directory

Delete and rename commands just do simple file operations.
A database can be renamed only if destination does not exists.

    Commands for reading and writing data:

$ graphene put <name> <time> <value1> ... <valueN> -- write data point
$ graphene get_next <extended name> [<time1>] -- get next point with t>=time1
$ graphene get_prev <extended name> [<time2>] -- get previous point with t<=time2

$ graphene get <extended name> [<time2>] -- For integer and text databases
  get is equivalent to get_prev. For double databases it does linear
  interpolation between points, or return the last point if time is larger
  then that of the newest point.

$ graphene get_range <extended name> [<time1>] [<time2>] [<dt>] -- Get
  points in the time range. If parameter dt>1 then data are filtered, only
  points with distance >dt between them are shown. This works fast for any
  ratio of dt and interpoint distance.

Default value for time1 is 0, for time2 is infinity. Word "now" can be
used to specify current time. If the database has no future timestamps,
then commands "get_prev name" and "get_prev name now" are equivalent.

Text values are printed with line breaks converted to spaces.

The "extended name" used in get_* commands have the following format:
<name>[:<column>][|<filter>]

<column> is a column number (0,1,..), if it exists, then only this
column is shown. If a certain column is requested but data array is not
long enough, a "NaN" value is returned. Columns are ignored for text data.

<filter> is a name of filter program, if it exists, the program is run and
data is filtered through it. The program should be located in the
database directory, program name can not contain '.:|+ \t\n' symbols.

    Commands for deleting data:

$ graphene del <name> <time>  -- delete a data point
$ graphene del_range  <name> [<time1>] [<time2>] -- delete all points in the range

    Interactive mode:

$ graphene interactive -- Interactive mode. Commands are read from stdin.
Allows making many requests without reopening databases.
Allows making a simple server with xinetd.

    Examples:

See examples/* in the source folder


=========================================================================
    HTTP + Simple JSON interface

The simple JSON interface can be used with grafana frontend to access
data (simple_json plugin is needed). Text databases can be viewed as
annotations, and numerical as metrics. Columns can be specified after
database name: <name>:<column>, default column is 0.

Usage: graphene_http [options]
Options:
 -p <port>  -- tcp port for connections (default 8081)
 -d <path>  -- database path (default /var/lib/graphene/)
 -v <level> -- be verbose
                0 - write nothing.
                1 - write some information on start
                2 - write info about connections
                3 - write input data
                4 - write output data
 -l <file>  -- log file, use '-' for stdout
               (default /var/log/graphene.log in daemon mode, '-' in)"
 -f         -- do fork and run as a daemon;
 -h         -- write help message and exit;

=========================================================================
    Matlab/octave interface

Nothing is ready yet. You can use something like this to get data using the
graphene program:

  [r, out] = system('graphene get_range my_dataset 1464260400000 now 60000');
  [t val1 val2] = strread(out, '%f %f %f');

=========================================================================
    Performance

Consider a situation: we want to measure some parameter for a year with
10 s period and put 8-byte double values into the database. This means 3.15
million points.

let's create a database DB and put all these points at once:
$ graphene -d . create DB
$ for t in $(seq 3153600); do printf "put DB $t $RANDOM\n"; done |
    ./graphene -d . interactive

This takes about 1 minute at my computer. Note that I use interactive
mode to write all points without reopening the database. If I do writing
with command-line interface it takes about 10 hours:

$ for t in $(seq 3153600); do ./graphene -d . put DB "$t" "$RANDOM"; done

Size of the database is 86 Mb, 28.6 bytes/point. Gzip can make in
smaller (17.5 Mb, 5.81 bytes/point), xz even smaller (8.8 Mb, 2.94
bytes/point).

If you have a few parameters which do not need separate timestamps, you
can put them into a multi-column data points (put DB $t $par1 $par2 ...)
saving some space. Database size grows by 8 bytes per additional column.

You can also configure the database to store 4-byte float values instead
of 8-byte doubles. It will save 4 bytes per data column.

Reading of all the points takes 15s:

$ time graphene -d . get_range DB | wc
15.81user 0.07system 0:15.90elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 5208maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+293minor)pagefaults 0swaps
3153600 6307200 41969235

Reading of last 3000 points, first 3000 points, every 1000th point takes
almost nothing:

$ time graphene -d . get_range DB 3150601 3153600 | wc
