Critical:
-- Handle \n in TEXT data properly
-- Safe databese names needed. Allow subpaths, do not allow ../, or
   absolute paths

Important:
-- "access" command
-- simple json output - for Grafana backend
-- Think about duplicated times. Now you can add it, but
   read only first point

Improvements:
-- user information
-- delete point/range
-- now_s and now_ms?
-- control double format on output?
